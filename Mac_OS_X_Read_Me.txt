To run the OS X Native front-end as a double-clickable .app:

1) Download and install the Python-Objective C bridge.
   http://pyobjc.sf.net/
2) Open a terminal window (in Applications->Utilities->Terminal)
3) Change to the directory where this readme file is located
  (ie, if it's on your desktop in a "PythonCad" folder, type
  'cd ~/Desktop/PythonCad' in the Terminal.
4) Type "python buildapp.py --semi-standalone build" in the terminal window.  
5) The PythonCad.app will be located in the newly created "build" directory.
   Drag it to wherever you usually keep your applications.

I make no guarantee this will work on OS X 10.2.  It might, it
might not.  If you can't get it to work, send an e-mail.  If
it doesn't work but you figure out how to fix it, send an-email.

Enjoy.
